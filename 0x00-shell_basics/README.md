## Shell Basics
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It is a program that provides a way for users to execute commands and run scripts on their computer.

Here are some basic shell commands:

1. ls: lists the contents of the current directory.
2. cd: changes the current working directory.
3. pwd: prints the current working directory.
4. mkdir: creates a new directory.
5. touch: creates a new file.
6. rm: removes a file or directory.
7. cp: copies a file or directory.
8. mv: moves a file or directory.
9. cat: displays the contents of a file.
10. grep: searches for a pattern in a file.

Shell scripts are sequences of shell commands that can be saved and executed as a file. They are used to automate tasks and are commonly used for system administration and other repetitive tasks. Shell scripts can be written in various scripting languages, such as Bash, Python, Perl, and Ruby.
